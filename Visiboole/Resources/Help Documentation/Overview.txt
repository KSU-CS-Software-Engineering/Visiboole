VisiBoole was created to be a digital logic teaching tool.  It consists of both a hardware description language (HDL) for expressing digital logic functions (components of digital systems) and a visual simulator for that language.  The interactive visual simulation can be used to acquire an in-depth understanding of basic Boolean gates and networks.  The color-coded simulation of Boolean expressions provides a more compact display and thus better tractability of Boolean logic (especially of larger designs) than having a schematic of a gate network displayed.  The use of signal names in multiple design statements implies wires connecting those points.  This also provides better tractability than a web of lines showing the interconnection of sections of a circuit diagram.  During simulation the color of each named signal provides a virtual logic probe attached to its value.  Clicking on a name toggles its value while clicking on a formatted field cycles through all combinations of values in the field making the testing and understanding of designs natural and easy.   Despite its inception as a teaching tool, VisiBoole has proven to be a surprisingly powerful digital design tool.  Its ability to support an incremental design approach where the designer switches back and forth between design and test mode after each small addition to the design has made the creation of complex designs surprisingly fast.  Further, they are virtually bug free as soon as they are completed.  The sections below introduce the HDL features from most basic to complex.  Note that all designing and testing can be accomplished using only the assignment statement so exploring designs in simulation mode can begin after writing a single statement.
