VisiBoole was created to be a digital logic teaching tool.  It consists of both a hardware description language (HDL) for expressing digital logic functions (components of digital systems) and a visual simulator for that language.  The interactive visual simulation can be used to acquire an in-depth understanding of basic Boolean gates and networks.  The color-coded simulation of Boolean expressions provides a more compact display and thus better tractability of larger designs than having actual gate networks displayed.  The color of each named signal provides a virtual logic probe connected to its value.  Despite its inception as a teaching tool, VisiBoole has proven to be surprisingly powerful as a digital design tool.  Its ability to support an incremental design approach where the designer switches back and forth between design and test mode after each small addition to the design has made the creation of complex designs surprisingly fast.  Further, they are virtually debugged as soon as they are completed.
