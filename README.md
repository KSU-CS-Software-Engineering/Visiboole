Visiboole is a simulator of a Hardware Description Language(HDL) of the same name derived from Verilog, an HDL itself - IEEE standard 1800-2017. Its primary function is to create models of digital circuits that display a text representation of components. With the value of each component updated in real time, Visiboole is designed for use as a teaching age that bypasses the need to use physical hardware when testing an HDL program.
 
Released as a standalone executable file, Visiboole requires no drivers or runtime environment updates. Designed as an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) the editing and execution of programs are dpne by the user through the Visiboole Interface with negligible compiling times. Similar to traditional IDEs Visiboole code can be saved to a file that can be later be opened, modified, or distributed. Visiboole files can be edited and saved in other text editors, but can only be executed by a running instance of Visiboole.
 
Full documentation of syntax is available in Visiboole, but among many others it has the following features  
  * Traditional logic gates: AND OR XOR. etc  
  * Use of constants, variables, and basic arithmetic  
  * Advancing a program through a clock cycle  
  * Language to create, manipulate, and compare multiple variables at once  
  * Writing and exevcution in base 2, 10, or 16  
  * Commenting and lax spacing  
      
  #### Visiboole supports large font sizes and a colorblind mode for visual accessiblility.
