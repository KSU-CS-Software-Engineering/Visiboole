Visiboole is a simulator of a Hardware Description Language(HDL) of the same name derived from Verilog, an HDL itself - IEEE standard 1800-2017. Its primary function is to create models of digital circuits that display a text representation of components. With the value of each component updated in real time, Visiboole is designed for use as a teaching aid that allows you to test programs without the need for physical hardware.
 
Released as a standalone executable file, Visiboole requires no drivers or runtime environment updates. Changing working modes runs  the program you are editing or returns you to the editing window when you stop the program. Similar to traditional IDEs Visiboole code can be saved to a file that can be later be opened, modified, or distributed. Visiboole files can be edited and saved in other text editors, but can only be executed by a running instance of Visiboole.
 
Among many others, Visiboole supports the following:  
  * Traditional logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, etc  
  * Use of constants, variables, and arithmetic  
  * Advancing a program through a clock cycle  
  * Language to create, manipulate, and compare multiple variables at once  
  * Operating in base 2, 10, or 16  
  * Commenting and lax spacing
